# Forest Whispers

_A poem about nature's quiet voice_

Among the towering ancient trees,  
Where shadows dance with morning breeze,  
The forest speaks in hushed refrain,  
Of sunshine, mist, and gentle rain.

Each leaf a page of wisdom old,  
Stories that will never be told,  
In whispers soft and branches high,  
Beneath the ever-changing sky.

The earth remembers every step,  
While forest guardians secrets keep,  
In nature's church of bark and stone,  
We're never truly alone.
