# raft

stuck in a raft

in the ocean of the lost

he had a single thread of hope

a paddle

it was right there, and yet he refused to use it

he refused to look ahead, saying

"this is the path i want anyways"

but who was he fooling but himself?

he was lost

there was no point in paddling since he didn't know where to go

but after years of waiting, his tormented mind realized

that he had to take control of the raft

and stop this neverending cycle

he wasn't lost anymore

he decided to change his course, despite not knowing where to go

and so his journey began

finally
