# open-ended

destined to not finish anything

an open-ended universe

in which every possibility is explored

but no conclusion is reached

the entity wandered

looking for questions to ask

eager to leave Plato's cave before the echo could even respond

and so it left

and finally

it got all of the answers

fear, love, hatred, happiness, disgust

the entity then learned about everything that it has ever thought about

all of the questions now had their own answers

and one by one they formed pairs, dancing around the entity's head

it was too much, however

and the entity was never seen again

did it go back to the cave? or did it...
