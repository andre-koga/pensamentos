friends

ah! the joy of friends

the ones that make you laugh

that make you change your plans last minute

to enjoy the thrills of what it means to live

the ones that validate you, that acknowledge you

the ones that reside in our memories

with silly moments and big events

the ones that concoct new experiences for us by accident

the ones that add detours to our adventures

the joy of friends is inexplicable, yet their doings are uncountable
