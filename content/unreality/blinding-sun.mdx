# blinding sun

by observing he learned to learn

he learned to admire

and he learned to feel

he could feel the strong passion of others

their resolves

and slowly but surely

his eyes filled with dreams

and what was once a dim light

became a blinding sun

his path was clear, now it was just a matter of taking it.
