# other half

it's a feeling that i can't reach

like an itch on my back that i can't reach

that i can't stop

but i know it's there, just there

half of me is asleep and i know it

i can't wake it up though

it's been dormant for so long

that i've grown desensitized

i know that i can wake it up

although that might just be my imagination, i fear

and so i stay still, unable to go

just watching my other half asleep

<br />

and so i wonder

who's gonna cease first?

is my other half going to wake up

or am i going to fall asleep
