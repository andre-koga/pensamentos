# punchline

lost in my egotistical wishes  
whining for no reason  
complaining about good things  
crying so people look at me  
pretending i have something to worry about

yeah, that sounds like me

and i'll keep losing my time  
my worthless, dumb time  
because that's how i am  
and i deserve it honestly  
i'll die alone, as it should be  
and i hope all my plans fail  
and...  
...  
stop. stop. STOP  
STOP GIVING ME HOPE

i just don't want it  
i'm not interested.  
just let me go  
(who is he talking to?)  
(nobody.)

this is all just a big joke  
and i'm the punchline  
wait, guess what  
i'm not part of the joke actually  
why would i be?

i removed the part where i am mentioned, remember?
