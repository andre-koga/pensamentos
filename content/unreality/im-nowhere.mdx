# i'm nowhere

i'm just fucking tired

i'm frustrated

i'm slowly disappearing

i'm here, i'm there

i was everywhere, now i'm nowhere

i tried to have something

to call my own

but now, like a shattered mirror

i just have little pieces that keep staring back at me

cutting my skin

Tainting my reflection with red
