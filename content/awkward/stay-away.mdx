# stay away

a single spark turns the dried grass into fire  
all the words flood my brain, trying to escape  
muffled scream, sweat, heavy breathing

i freeze, weeping

all the thoughts, all the worries, all the fears
triggered  
...  
i'm sorry, i tried to make this poem look good  
...

but you made me panic so much  
...that nothing better will come out

the yesterday now set in stone stressed me out more
than all my previous midterms and finals combined

(haha...)

stay away.
