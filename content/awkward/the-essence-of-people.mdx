# the essence of people

the essence of people, muted  
wind picks up, taking the sand up and away in a whirlwind  
left are a few grains under the scorching sun  
nothing can be made from what remains

i sit down, stand up, walk around  
i sit back down, pondering

the grains aren't more than that, grains  
and yet they frustrate  
or are their limitations to blame?  
in an impetus, i feel impatient  
i think about eating the few grains left, swallowing them to never be seen again  
they scrape my throat, bleeding down my stomach

i finish my meal,  
i stand up,

and satisfied i continue my walk
