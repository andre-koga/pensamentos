# Forest Whispers

_A contemplative piece about the ancient wisdom found in nature_

Among the towering ancient trees,  
Where shadows dance with morning breeze,  
The forest speaks in hushed refrain,  
Of sunshine, mist, and gentle rain.

Each leaf a page of wisdom old,  
Stories that will never be told,  
In whispers soft and branches high,  
Beneath the ever-changing sky.

The earth remembers every step,  
While forest guardians secrets keep,  
In nature's church of bark and stone,  
We're never truly alone.

_This poem captures the quiet conversations between human consciousness and the natural world, where ancient trees hold stories spanning centuries._
