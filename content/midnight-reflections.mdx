# Midnight Reflections

_Thoughts that emerge in the stillness of night_

When darkness falls and silence reigns,  
The mind breaks free from daily chains,  
In shadows deep, truth finds its voice,  
And consciousness makes its choice.

The stars above keep watch tonight,  
As inner worlds come into sight,  
Each thought a spark, each dream a flame,  
In solitude, we're not the same.

_This piece captures the unique clarity that emerges during quiet midnight hours._
