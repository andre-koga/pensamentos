# Ocean Dreams

_The endless rhythm of waves and thoughts_

Upon the shore where waters meet,  
The sand beneath my restless feet,  
Waves roll in with ancient song,  
Carrying dreams both deep and long.

The ocean speaks in whispered tones,  
Of distant lands and unknown zones,  
Each wave a thought, each tide a dream,  
Nothing here is as it seems.

In blue expanse, the mind finds peace,  
Where earthly worries find release,  
The horizon calls with endless grace,  
In water's depths, we find our place.

_This poem captures the meditative quality of the ocean and its ability to inspire deep reflection._
