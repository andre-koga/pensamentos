# Deep Forest Whispers

_Voices from the heart of the ancient woods_

Deeper than the morning mist,  
Where sunlight and shadow twist,  
Ancient voices softly call,  
Through the cathedral of it all.

Moss-covered stones remember when,  
This forest knew no sound of men,  
Only wind through leafy halls,  
And the echo of distant falls.

Here in nature's sacred space,  
Time moves at a different pace,  
Teaching those who pause to hear,  
Wisdom gathered year by year.

_This piece captures the profound silence and ancient wisdom found in the deepest parts of old forests._
