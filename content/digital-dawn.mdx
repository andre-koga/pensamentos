# The Digital Dawn

_A poem about the awakening of digital consciousness_

In the quiet hum of servers bright,  
Where data flows like morning light,  
A thousand thoughts begin to dance,  
In silicon's eternal trance.

The screen awakens, pixel-clear,  
Reflecting dreams we hold so dear,  
Each keystroke marks a story told,  
In binary, both new and old.

_This poem explores the metaphorical awakening of our digital world, comparing the constant hum of technology to the gentle break of dawn._
