# Midnight Thoughts

_Reflections that emerge in the quiet hours of the night_

In the silence of the midnight hour,  
When the world has lost its power,  
Thoughts arise like gentle waves,  
From the depths where daylight saves.

Stars above keep silent watch,  
As memories we cannot botch,  
Dance across the canvas dark,  
Each one leaving its own mark.

In this space between the days,  
Where the restless spirit plays,  
Truth emerges, soft and clear,  
Whispering what we need to hear.

_This poem explores the unique clarity that often comes in the quiet, contemplative hours of the night when our minds are free to wander._
