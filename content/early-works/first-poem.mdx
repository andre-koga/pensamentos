# First Steps

_My very first attempt at digital poetry_

Tentative words on empty screen,  
Cursor blinking, thoughts unseen,  
Each letter placed with careful doubt,  
Wondering what it's all about.

Simple lines and simple rhyme,  
Marking this, my starting time,  
In the world of digital verse,  
For better or perhaps for worse.

_This poem represents the beginning of my journey into digital poetry creation._
