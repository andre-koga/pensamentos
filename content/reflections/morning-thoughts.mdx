# Morning Thoughts

_Reflections as the day begins_

The sun breaks through the window pane,  
Washing away the night's refrain,  
Fresh light brings hope and new desire,  
Setting dormant dreams on fire.

In morning's grace, we find renewal,  
Each dawn a chance for life's revival,  
The coffee steams, the world awakens,  
Another day, another make sense.

What will this day bring to unfold?  
What stories will today be told?  
In morning light, all seems possible,  
The future bright, accessible.
