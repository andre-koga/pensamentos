# Tightrope Walk

But even with all these poems,

I thought I could achieve something,

a shallow belief in a tightrope walk.

One tremor and I'm plunged into the abyss,

no going back.

I wonder what purpose these emotions serve,

anger, sadness, rejection?

They must serve a purpose,

but like a never-ending game,

there's no winner,

and eventually, the game loses its charm.
