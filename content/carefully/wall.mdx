# wall

poisonous enmity,

out-of-sync compartments,

scattered emotion, sharp mind.

loading...

complete depersonalization, absolute animosity.

distant sounds, shattered emotions, thrown against the wall

that vilely observed the inhabitants of the Earth.

cold, calculating, null, inert, immobile, intangible.

wall of dominoes, wall of mirrors,

where a mere left step collapses downhill.

utters hatred, conjugates spells.

oh, indifferent wall, why the grievances?

lost are the lapses of humanity, bound by threads, carried by the wind.

cold wind aspiring the colony, final trace of the wall's soul.

without colony, without soul, without emotions, without anything:

the wall hesitated to escape

<br />

and defeated, knelt in lamentations.
