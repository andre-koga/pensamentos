# Dance

"What do I do with my life?"

Balanced on the railing, swinging legs back and forth.

Babbling, laughing, grumbling, crying.

Undeniably lost.

He couldn't contain himself.

Looking at the abyss that engulfed him and the sky that comforted him.

Life's ironies turned his fate into a diamond-studded stage play.

What's left but to laugh and dance?
