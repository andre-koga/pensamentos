# predictable

predictability is my baseline,  
my inseparable friend,  
my trustworthy calmness.

nothing bad ever happens tomorrow,  
nothing bad ever happened yesterday,  
so why should today be different?

nothing good ever happens tomorrow,  
nothing good ever happened yesterday,  
so why should today be different?

predictability in the unpredictable,  
that's my curse.
