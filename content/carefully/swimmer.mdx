# Swimmer

"I want to dive into the water!" exclaimed the swimmer.

The planet covered in water invited him for a stroll.

Cursed, however.

The water was shallow.

Mere centimeters covered everything.

Enough for him not to lie down,
enough for him to achieve nothing.

The torture that the swimmer endured.

What would become of him, a mere swimmer,
on a planet flooded with shallow water?

Kneeling was not enough; sitting was not enough;
lying down was not enough either.

Slowly, the swimmer went mad.

He prayed to the gods for rain to come so that he could swim.

The request was promptly answered.

With rain, the sea rose.

The swimmer was happy for a few moments.

He swam breaststroke, backstroke, in every way.

Fatigue came early, and suddenly the swimmer had nowhere to stand.

Without ground, without footing, without an escape,
the swimmer tried to survive as long as possible.

<br />

But it wasn't enough. The swimmer died.
