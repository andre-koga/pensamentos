# Mirror

High desire, on the pedestal

Platinum mirror, pure mirror.

Reflection that breaks the solitude

Mirror that breaks, alone.

Unfortunate discovery, I discovered.

Disillusioned mirror; no, disillusioned was the reflection.

Dizzy, the mirror tumbled

Shards pierced his skin

Pierced his eyes

And pierced his mind

Which, devastated, no longer thought.

Poisonous desire, desire... poison.

Never again.
