# movie

a frustrating ending  
to a movie that wasn't watched, but lived,  
prolonged until its limits

the protagonist? not decisive enough to do anything.  
the coadjuvants took over,  
and he just watched from the sidelines  
no climax, no conclusion, no development.  
he went back home empty-handed,  
ready to do it all again,  
with an ache in his heart,  
with hopes that something would happen, despite his inability to act.  
but nothing happened.  
and eventually, time ran out,  
and he had to leave.  
_...i guess i do like the special treatment_
