# child

and as he laid there crying,  
all of his creations long gone  
from the cage of his mind...

as alone as ever,  
before the gates of Heaven,  
the only things he could show as proof  
of his life

were an expression of shock,  
and a muttered sorry.

his ego, his dreams, his fantasies, and disillusions... none could come with him.
