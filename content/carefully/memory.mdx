# memory

the walk back from a day that once happened  
remains as nothing but a memory,

<br />

yet the cold sight of my breath mixing with the air is so tangible,  
the hues of black, purple, and yellow so nostalgic,  
the walls just passing by...

<br />

have you ever felt out of "it"?  
whatever that might even mean?

<br />

have you ever felt like you were listening to the music of life through a muffled wall?

<br />

and yet the vast, vast lack of feelings and thoughts and wishes and fears... it all feels so nice
