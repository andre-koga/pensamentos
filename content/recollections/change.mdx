# change

how much i've changed over time!

but despite so much change, my words...  
stubborn and lazy, they refuse to change

why do they stick to me the same way,  
even though years have passed?

why do they demand to stay,  
following my steps as shadows of my old self?

these four walls confine me,  
but why, oh why

do these words have to remain,

unchanged?
