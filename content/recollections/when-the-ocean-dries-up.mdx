# when the ocean dries up

and I find myself laying down on the bottom, looking up  
surrounded by flapping fish and dead  
corals

what will I see? what will I feel?

the echoes at the bottom are deafening,  
the echoes at the bottom are exhausting.

the substrate glues to my skin,  
the ignorance engulfs me whole,  
and my heart stops beating on volition.
