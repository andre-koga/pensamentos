# actually

i'm just like you

actually, no  
i'm not like you  
and just like a train  
that hit me out of nowhere  
i'm alone again  
:)

i feel miserable  
i've never felt my hands this cold  
even though i'm sure they've been colder

wow  
i genuinely feel sick  
ill, like i was about to puke  
corroding inside, like i just committed a crime  
why

i don't deserve this
