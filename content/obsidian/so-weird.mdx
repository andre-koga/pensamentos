# so weird

it's so weird how life works  
weird how they are now a couple  
weird how i'm here in this room,  
next to the couple i helped,  
one floor below the girl that i used to like

or do i still like her?

weird how i can hear her crying in my imagination

or is it really my imagination?

even though i can't help anymore

or rather

she doesn't want my help anymore  
even though she still cries  
now, alone

like me

please

it truly was unpredictable  
this outcome

just a reminder  
that i have no control  
or at least, not as much  
as i thought

and that i'm no protagonist in this life of mine  
no one is

trust me, i'm stronger than ever  
but i still wonder  
if i was happier  
before without knowing it

i miss the miniscule amount of time  
that we had together,

i'm sorry i couldn't make you feel the same

it hurts that i couldn't enjoy much of what we had  
it ended so fast  
why? what you said before  
was it a lie?

so  
so  
weird
