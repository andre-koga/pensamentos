# please don't come back

solitude  
stay way  
stop right now  
so i don't cry again  
sorry for my  
self

how come  
i felt actually pretty fine  
but now that the night has come  
and i am alone  
the solitude comes full force  
like it has never left me  
not even once  
i am not kidding  
this scares me

i'm not lonely  
i'm not lonely  
i'm not lonely

this feels terrible
