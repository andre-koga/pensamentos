# i hate it

i hate the way i care too much

i actually hate it
it makes me hate you
it makes me hate myself
it makes me feel terrible

how can you care so little
i bet
when i disappeared
you couldn't help but sigh out of relief
and smile

i hate that i care about you
and i hate you

i hate that i'll forgive you
because i can't deal with this

i truly
truly
truly
hate you
