# old people

it's hard to describe but  
looking at old people  
filled with will to live  
sharing their stories  
with a smile in their faces  
and hope for the tomorrow  
makes me so  
so proud of humanity  
and allows me to forget  
even if just for some minutes  
the chaos that surrounds

i think about the struggles they've been through  
the adventures and mishaps  
the discoveries  
the moments of sadness  
and moments of happiness  
because, even through all of the turmoil ( that is life  
they still choose to live
