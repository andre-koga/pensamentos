# i don't want to stay

i don't want to stay  
but i don't want to go

i'm stuck in the past  
inside and outside my mind  
my reality is what i feared  
and still fear

why would destiny  
play with me this way  
it's not their fault  
it's your

**yes, your**

indeed, to be alone and to be lonely  
can be very, very different

the closer i get to you  
the colder my heart gets  
and the further we feel

did i do something wrong  
please tell me  
i won't make the same mistake  
you can bet on it
