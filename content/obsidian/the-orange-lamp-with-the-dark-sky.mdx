# the orange lamp with the dark sky

there's something i can't describe  
when i look at the orange glow  
of lamps outside  
with the dark sky

something so empty, so void of meaning  
to think that the sky can't hear us...  
to imagine the cold wind, the darkness, the blue tones of the walls  
buildings surrounding "me"

with people right on the other side of the wall

the sky doesn't care about you
