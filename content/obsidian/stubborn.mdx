# stubborn

you know what?

my life is just a game  
an advanced simulation  
of an advanced computer  
in some advanced civilization

i don't care  
whether i fail or succeed  
so i'll live life  
without regrets  
without restraints

i'll do what i want  
and i'll do it to the fullest  
i'll learn about every emotion  
and every sensation  
just so i don't regret  
the opportunities i lost  
and the people i couldn't meet

i have to live life like this  
because i fear losing time more than anyone else  
like a timer that i can see  
i know that nothing is infinite  
specially me

and you're no exception  
i'm determined to suffer for you  
cry for you  
and try for you  
even though i know,  
deep down,  
i'm doing this for myself  
and for my fear of not living life, as it was meant to be

i'm stubborn  
i'm narcissistic  
i'm selfish  
i'm self-centered  
and you know what?

i've decided  
you're my next goal

either we both win  
or we both lose

i won't give up
