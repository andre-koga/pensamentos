# heart

when my heart beats fast,  
know that it has nothing to do with you,  
i'm just sick

when my heart beats loudly,  
know the fear in my eyes  
because i don't know when it'll end (me)

i don't control it anymore  
it stole my future and my plans  
and it scares me

sadly, it's stuck inside me  
nowhere to go  
nowhere to run

i feel it pulse  
i feel it scream  
and all i can do  
is listen to it  
do its own thing
