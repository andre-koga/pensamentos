# ah, im feeling like that again

i can't turn off my brain  
for some reason, nothing's good enough today  
they're too busy with their own lives  
which is how it is supposed to happen  
but why am i stuck  
while everything moves?

am i the problem? am i doing something wrong? what should i do?

why am i feeling empty

why do i feel left out?
