# homage to Duning-Kruger

i like to think of intelligence  
as a torch that each of us hold  
inside the cave that is everything

how can one know  
what is surrounded by darkness?  
the brighter ones can only assume  
how much they have yet to see  
while the dimmer ones can only assume  
that they've seen pretty much everything

strength, i add  
isn't everything (luckily)  
as one can still cover a lot of the darkness  
by exploring  
surpassing the brighter ones  
that don't move at all

~also,  
as a happy conclusion  
one might think  
that the closest to a fully illuminated cave  
is when everyone has their own role  
in their own spot of the cave,  
each of us helping the next  
see the cave a little bit better~
